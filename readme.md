Overview
-

This is the Income Proving API.

Technical Notes
-

The API is implemented using Spring Boot.  It is intended to allow the team to compare and contrast with
the API previously built using Spark Java.

API Notes
-
* The API will only return enough information to support the current UI tools needs
* The API will NOT return the search parameters used by the client
* The API will use resources and restful ideas as much as possible
* The API will only support accepting and returning JSON data

Examples will follow once the API redesign is done.
